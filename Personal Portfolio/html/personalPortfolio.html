            Abhisek(Abi) Rai loves reading, traveling most of all playing with his 2 kids, Henna Bree and Kiaan Logan.
            <br> 
            Wait a minute, lets clear this up. He does not love talking in 3rd person, but it is what it is so here we go.
            <br> 
            He enjoys going out with them to eat Japanese food (family favourite!), play at the beach and tell them stories he reads online. 
            <br>
            He does all that while being in the military as part of Air Defence of his countryâ€™s skies. 
            <br>
            No mean feat I must say, when all of you are asleep, he is awake making sure everyone gets to sleep soundly. 
            <br>
            Including his family back home. Nothing beat doing something which has so much purpose, and with purpose comes fulfilment.
            <br>
            Well, over time he has found something new that he wants to do. Inspired by family and ever blossoming technologies all over the world. 
            <br>
            He wants to find purpose in programming. So here is with his first project. Enjoy:)
