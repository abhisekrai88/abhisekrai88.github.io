            <p class="para1">
            Abhisek(Abi) Rai loves reading, traveling most of all playing with his 2 kids, Henna Bree and Kiaan Logan.
            Wait a minute, lets clear this up. He does not love talking in 3rd person, but it is what it is so here we go. 
            He enjoys going out with them to eat Japanese food (family favourite!), play at the beach and tell them stories he reads online. 
            He does all that while being in the military as part of Air Defence of his country’s skies. 
            No mean feat I must say, when all of you are asleep, he is awake making sure everyone gets to sleep soundly. 
            Including his family back home. Nothing beat doing something which has so much purpose, and with purpose comes fulfilment.
            Well, over time he has found something new that he wants to do. Inspired by family and ever blossoming technologies all over the world. 
            He wants to find purpose in programming. So here is with his first project. Enjoy:)
